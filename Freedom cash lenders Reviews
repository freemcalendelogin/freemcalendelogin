Credit insurance increases the cost of borrowing by more than a third while providing minimal consumer benefit. Customers finance credit insurance premiums because the full amount is charged upfront rather than monthly, as with most other insurance. Purchasing insurance and financing the premiums adds significant costs to the loans, but customers pay far more than they benefit from the coverage, as indicated by credit insurers’ extremely low loss ratios—the share of premium dollars paid out as benefits. These ratios are considerably lower than those in other insurance markets and in some cases are less than the minimum required by state regulators.
